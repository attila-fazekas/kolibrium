/**
 * Base type for Kolibrium decorators.
 *
 * A decorator augments Selenium objects while keeping the original API untouched. In Kolibrium
 * we decorate the [SearchContext] contract itself (both [WebDriver] and [WebElement] implement it)
 * so that returned elements are also decorated, enabling safe chaining across nested component trees.
 *
 * Implementors usually override [decorateSearchContext] to intercept `findElement(s)` and return
 * elements wrapped via [decorateElement]. If you need to alter element behaviour (e.g. cache state
 * or add side‑effects), provide those overrides in [decorateElement].
 *
 * Notes
 * - This mechanism is independent of Selenium’s EventFiringDecorator. Some decorators may still use
 *   a [org.openqa.selenium.support.events.WebDriverListener] internally for interaction callbacks,
 *   but chaining is always preserved through the Kolibrium wrappers.
