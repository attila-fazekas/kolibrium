/**
 * Base configuration for an application under test.
 *
 * A [Site] centralizes cross-cutting defaults and policies for your tests:
 * - Where your app lives ([baseUrl])
 * - Which cookies should always be present for a new WebDriver session
 * - Default waiting behavior used by pages and element interactions
 * - An optional, session-aware configuration hook
 *
 * Declarative vs. imperative configuration
 * - Prefer declarative properties on the site ([cookies], [waitConfig]) for stable, site-wide policy that
 *   the framework can apply deterministically before the first real navigation.
 * - Use [configureBrowser] only for exceptional, dynamic, or environment-specific logic that truly
 *   requires a live session.
 *
 * Lifecycle and ordering
 * - The test DSL binds the active site to the current thread, creates a [WebDriver] session, navigates to
 *   [baseUrl] to establish origin, applies declarative [cookies] (if any), then re-navigates to [baseUrl]
 *   so cookies take effect immediately. Finally, it calls [configure] with the driver, which runs
 *   [configure] (no-arg) first and then [configureBrowser].
 * - Never navigate in [configureBrowser]; keep it fast and idempotent.
 *
 * @property baseUrl Base URL used by pages and the test DSL to build absolute routes.

     * - Prefer this over mutating cookies from [configureBrowser] whenever values are static/stable.

     * - Site-level decorators are merged with test-level decorators registered via [dev.kolibrium.core.selenium.decorators.DecoratorManager].

     * - Order is deterministic: site-level first, then test-level (after de-duplication).
     * - If any decorator is [dev.kolibrium.core.selenium.decorators.InteractionAware], their WebDriver listeners are
     *   multiplexed behind a single Selenium [org.openqa.selenium.support.events.EventFiringDecorator] proxy so only one
     *   WebDriver wrapper is used per session.
