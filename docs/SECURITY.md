# Reporting Security Issues and Vulnerabilities

Security is of utmost importance to us at the Kolibrium project, and we take it seriously. Whether it's the code we write or the dependencies we use, security is always a top priority.

If you believe youâ€™ve discovered a security issue in Kolibrium, kindly refrain from publicly disclosing the issue before we have had the opportunity to address it. Avoid opening an issue or pull request, as this may expose the problem to malicious actors.

For reporting security issues, please  contact us at [kolibrium2023@gmail.com](mailto:kolibrium2023@gmail.com).

Your cooperation in responsibly handling these matters is greatly appreciated.
